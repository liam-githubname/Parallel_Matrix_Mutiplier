# Multi-threaded Matrix Multiplier

## Why? 
  - Assignment for my parallel processign class.
  - Meant to gain experience with the fundamentals of parallelizing workloads. 
  - It was also a simple way to gain an understanding of the rust idiomatics.

## What? 
  - It's a command line tool that takes two matrices and multiplies them.
  - It has it's limitations, it contains some error handling and supports semi-graceful shut down if it ecounters runtime errors but it is a naive attempt of the rust way of doing things.

## Installation
  If you did want to install this for some reason:
      ``` 
      git clone https://github.com/liam-githubname/Parallel_Matrix_Mutiplier.git
      ```
